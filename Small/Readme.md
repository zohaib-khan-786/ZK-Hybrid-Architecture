ZMA – Zohaib Modular Architecture
ZMA (Zohaib Modular Architecture) is a scalable, modular approach to building applications that lets you start small and grow without painful rewrites.

The core idea:

Build once, scale forever.
Start with a small, clean structure. As your app grows to medium or full scale — or even to microservices — you keep the same foundation.

This architecture is perfect for teams who:

Start with a monolith but plan to scale later.

Want clear boundaries between features.

Prefer code organization that evolves with the product.

1️. Small-Scale Structure
Ideal for prototypes, MVPs, or small internal tools.
Everything is simple, but still separated into layers for maintainability.

2️. Medium-Scale Structure
When the project grows, modules are introduced in the Application and Infrastructure layers to keep features isolated.

3️. Full-Scale / Microservices Structure
Each feature becomes its own independent service, still following the same ZMA layer structure.

Why ZMA Works
Zero rewrite scaling – the structure simply expands.

Clear module boundaries – easier to maintain, test, and deploy.

Microservice-ready – design services like microservices from day one.

ZMA blends the familiarity of Clean Architecture with the flexibility of modular monoliths, making it an excellent choice for long-term projects.
